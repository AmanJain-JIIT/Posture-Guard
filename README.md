# Posture-Guard
# A Posture Detection and Alarming System

# Overview
Posture Guard is an innovative system designed to monitor and improve posture using computer vision, machine learning, and real-time feedback. This project aims to address the increasingly prevalent issue of poor posture resulting from prolonged screen time, particularly in contemporary professional and academic environments.

# Features
    - Real-time posture analysis using webcam
    - Immediate visual and audio feedback for corrective action
    - Robust posture classification algorithm
    - Data tracking for monitoring posture habits
    - User-friendly interface for ease of use

# How it Works
Posture Guard utilizes computer vision algorithms to analyze users' posture in real-time. By capturing images from a webcam, the system classifies posture into predefined categories such as "Normal," "Neck," "Shoulders," "Forward Bend," and "Backward Bend." Based on the classification results, the system provides immediate feedback to the user, encouraging them to correct their posture as needed.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training the posture classification model consists of approximately 40,000 images labeled across five posture classes. The dataset was collected and preprocessed to ensure diversity and quality, enabling effective training of the machine learning model.

# Performance Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using a testing dataset, divided into multiple phases to assess its robustness and generalization capabilities. The evaluation metrics include precision, recall, F1-score, and support, providing insights into the model's accuracy and reliability across different scenarios.

# Deployment
Posture Guard was deployed as a standalone application using Tkinter GUI for the user interface. The application can be installed on Windows systems using PyInstaller and INNO Setup, offering a user-friendly experience for posture monitoring and correction.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, Posture Guard represents a significant advancement in posture monitoring technology, offering a scalable and accessible solution for improving posture habits. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system provides real-time feedback to users, promoting better posture and mitigating musculoskeletal health risks associated with prolonged screen time.
